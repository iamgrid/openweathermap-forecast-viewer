# OpenWeatherMap Forecast Viewer

[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) has a really lovely forecast API where you can see weather for the upcoming 5 day period in fantastic detail. This project is mostly for my own benefit as I've found the OWM predictions to be more on the spot for where I live than any weather forecast website operated in Hungary. 

**The live version of this app is hosted at https://iamgrid.co.uk/openweathermap-forecast-viewer/.**

**Packages/technologies in use:**
- Next.js
